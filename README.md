# Axe-Man
An animated lumber jack uses an axe to chop down a tree

This was a program assignment for CS 559: Computer Graphics, Spring 2018

Using hierarchical 2D modeling, the lumber jack's arm swings the axe up and down to simulate a chopping motion. There is a slider below the canvas that controls the man's position. As the man is moved closer to the tree, he slowly chops away at the tree until it falls down when the slider is all the way to the right.
